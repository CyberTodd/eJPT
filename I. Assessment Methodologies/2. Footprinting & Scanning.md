#### Mapping a Network

- Purpose - Find the scope. Talk with your client the what, why, of your pentest and the tools available.

- Process: - Physical Access
				- Sniffing
				- ARP
				- ICMP
	- Physical Access - Physical Security, OSINT, Social Engineering, etc
	- Sniffing  - Passive Reconnaissance
						- Watch network traffic
	- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses (discovering the link layer address);
	- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - is used to test network connectivity issues;
										- Traceroute
										- Ping

- Tools:  - WIRESHARK - 
			 - ARP-SCAN
			 - PING
			 - FPING - is like ping, but sends pings on multiple hosts
			 - NMAP
			 - Zenmap - GUI version of nmap

#### Port Scanning

- Purpose - Identify Operating Systems
				 - Identify Services
						- this will help to see if we have to deal with some firewalls, or servers, etc.

How to scan for services?

- Connect to TCP 
	- we scan for different ports and check the responses; 
	- we do the three-way handshake; we send SYN -> SYN + ACK -> ACK -> RST + ACK; 
		- if we get this we know the port is **opened**.
	- if the port is **closed** we initiate a SYN and the response is a RST + ACK;
	- the stealthy mode - SYN -> SYN + ACK -> RST;
- Connect to UDP
	- they are slower;
	- open, filtered;
	- can be speed up by applying certain flags in nmap;

- Tools: - Zenmap
			- NMAP Automator
			- Masscan
			- Rustscan
			- Autorecon - similar to nmap automator;
