>**Information Gathering is probably the most important step in a penetration test, because, in this step, you map out all the information that will help you in later stages of the test.**

---
Generally, the information you can obtain from a pen test, is split into two main categories:
		- Passive Information Gathering
		- Active Information Gathering

- Passive Information Gathering - in this process, you gather as much information as possible about your target, from publicly available sources; 
													- You do not engage actively with the system;
													- You don't need permission to scan the target;
- Active Information Gathering   - in this process, you gather as much information as possible by actively engaging with the system;
													- You **NEED PERMISSION** to scan the target;

---
#### What information can we gather?

In a passive scan:
- IP addresses, DNS information;
- hidden files;
- names, emails, phone numbers, physical addresses, social media profiles;
- domains, subdomains, domains ownerships;
- web technologies that are being used;

In an active scan:
- open ports;
- learn about the network and the organization infrastructure;
- enumerate information;

---
#### What processes can we use?

- Website Reconnaissance
- Footprinting - is similar to Web. Recon., but you gather more info;

---
#### Tools and Commands

- Terminal - on Linux
``` Powershell

whatis host # similar to -help in cmd

host url # performs a DNS lookup; it translates the domain into the related IPv4, IPv6

whatweb url # profiler tool, preinstalled on Kali

```

- On the actual Website
	- we can check for any information displayed, like authors, emails, social media links, etc. 

- On the URL
	- domain/*robots.txt* - is a file from a Search Engine index that shows what files the Search Engine is indexing or not;
	- domain/*sitemap_index.xml, sitemap.xml or sitemaps.xml* - provides Search Engines an organized way of indexing the website;

- SE Add-ons
	- FIREFOX
		- BuiltWith    - is a web site profiler tool that tells you what technologies are running on the target;
								- it also gives information about the subdomains;
		- Wappalyzer - is another profiler;

- Website Copier - analyze the code of a website
	- HTTrack 

- WHOIS - is a query and response protocol
	- WHO.is can be used on the browser;
	- there is also the terminal tool;

``` Powershell
whois domain # provides very useful info about the domain | Registrars, Update, Creation, Status

```

- Netcraft.com - shows all the information from above in one place;
	- Internet Research Tools: domain;

- DNSRecon - is a python script that provides all NS Records for zone transfers; Enumerates DNS Records
	- preinstalled on Kali;
```Powershell
dnsrecon  -d domain #provides name server (NS), IPv4 (A), IPv6 (AAAA), mail server (MX)
```

- dnsdumpster.com - performs dns recon & research, find & lookup dns records
