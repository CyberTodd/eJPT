>**Information Gathering is probably the most important step in a penetration test, because, in this step, you map out all the information that will help you in later stages of the test.**

---
Generally, the information you can obtain from a pen test, is split into two main categories:
		- Passive Information Gathering
		- Active Information Gathering

- Passive Information Gathering - in this process, you gather as much information as possible about your target, from publicly available sources; 
													- You do not engage actively with the system;
													- You don't need permission to scan the target;
- Active Information Gathering   - in this process, you gather as much information as possible by actively engaging with the system;
													- You **NEED PERMISSION** to scan the target;

---
#### What information can we gather?

In a passive scan:
- IP addresses, DNS information;
- hidden files;
- names, emails, phone numbers, physical addresses, social media profiles;
- domains, subdomains, domains ownerships;
- web technologies that are being used;

In an active scan:
- open ports;
- learn about the network and the organization infrastructure;
- enumerate information;

---
#### What processes can we use?

- Website Reconnaissance
- Footprinting - is similar to Web. Recon., but you gather more info;

---
#### Tools and Commands
#### Passive Information Gathering

- Terminal - on Linux
``` Powershell

whatis [host] # similar to -help in cmd

host [url] # performs a DNS lookup; it translates the domain into the related IPv4, IPv6

whatweb [url] # profiler tool, preinstalled on Kali

```

- On the actual Website
	- we can check for any information displayed, like authors, emails, social media links, etc. 

- On the URL
	- domain/*robots.txt* - is a file from a Search Engine index that shows what files the Search Engine is indexing or not;
	- domain/*sitemap_index.xml, sitemap.xml or sitemaps.xml* - provides Search Engines an organized way of indexing the website;

- SE Add-ons
	- FIREFOX
		- BuiltWith    - is a web site profiler tool that tells you what technologies are running on the target;
								- it also gives information about the subdomains;
		- Wappalyzer - is another profiler;

- Website Copier - analyze the code of a website
	- HTTrack 

- WHOIS - is a query and response protocol
	- WHO.is can be used on the browser;
	- there is also the terminal tool;

``` Powershell
whois [domain] # provides very useful info about the domain | Registrars, Update, Creation, Status

```

- Netcraft.com - shows all the information from above in one place;
	- Internet Research Tools: domain;

- DNSRecon - is a py script that provides all NS Records for zone transfers; Enumerates DNS Records
	- preinstalled on Kali;
```Powershell
dnsrecon  -d [domain] #provides name server (NS), IPv4 (A), IPv6 (AAAA), mail server (MX)
```

- dnsdumpster.com - performs dns recon & research, find & lookup dns records
	- similar to dnsrecon

- wafw00f - Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detection tool
```Powershell
wafw00f [domain]
```

- Sublist3r - py tool to enumerate subdomains using OSINT
```Powershell
sublist3r -d [domain] -e [engine] #it requests a ton of request
```

- Google Dorks - files search
	- intitle: index of - is a misconfiguration called directory listing, you rarely want this on for a production site because it can show the contents of it;
	- site:domain - resumes all searches to the domain you provide; will also show the subdomains;
	- inurl:passwd.txt
	- site:domain category
	- site:domain inurl:admin - search a specific panel;
	- site:*.domain.com - shows subdomains - what sublist3r is doing;
	- site:*.domain.com intitle:admin
	- site:*.domain.com filetype:pdf 

- WayBackMachine - archive.org - provides with snapshops of websites

- Google Hacking Database - is the best location to go when you're using Google Docks
	- exploit-db.com

- theHarvester - OSING gathering - similar to sublist3r
```Powershell
theHarvester -d [domain] -b [engine]
```

- DataBreach check - haveibeenpwned.com

---
#### Active Information Gathering

- DNS Zone Transfers - can offer a pen tester a view of an organization network layout;
	- Typical information on a DNS Server are the DNS Records;

- Previously used, useful tools: dnsdumpster.com, dnsrecon, 

- DNS Enum 
```Powershell
dnsenum [domain] # it can reveal internal networks
```

> Use the hosts file when you want to map a specific domain locally.

- Discover Hosts on a network with Nmap (nmap is a tool for network exploration and security auditing)
```Powershell
sudo nmap -sn [subnet]

sudo netdiscover -i interface -r network range or the subnet # another tool for host discovery
```

- Discover open ports and services that are running on them
```Powershell
nmap -Pn [ip] # scans for open ports 

nmap -Pn -p 80 [ip] # scans only for ports 80 - filtered states could mean proxy or that is closed

nmap -Pn -p1-1000 [ip] # scans from 1-1000 ports  

nmap -Pn -sU [ip] # will perform a UDP scan, by default will scan for TCP ports

nmap -Pn -F -sV [ip] # identifies the specific services running on the specific ports

nmap -Pn -F -sC [ip] # will run some scripts on opened ports
```
