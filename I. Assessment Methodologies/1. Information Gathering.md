> Information Gathering is probably the most important step in a penetration test, because, in this step, you map out all the information that will help you in later stages of the test.

---

Generally, the information you can obtain from a pen test, is split into two main categories:
		- Passive Information Gathering
		- Active Information Gathering

- Passive Information Gathering - in this process, you gather as much information as possible about your target, from publicly available sources; 
													- You do not engage actively with the system;
													- You don't need permission to scan the target;
- Active Information Gathering   - in this process, you gather as much information as possible by actively engaging with the system;
													- You **NEED PERMISSION** to scan the target;

What information can we gather?

In a passive scan:
- IP addresses, DNS information;

- names, emails, phone numbers, physical addresses, social media profiles;
- domains, subdomains, domains o
