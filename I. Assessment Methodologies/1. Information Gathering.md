> Information Gathering is probably the most important step in a penetration test, because, in this step, you map out all the information that will help you in later stages of the test.

---
Generally, the information you can obtain from a pen test, is split into two main categories:
		- Passive Information Gathering
		- Active Information Gathering

- Passive Information Gathering - in this process, you gather as much information as possible about your target, from publicly available sources; 
													- You do not engage actively with the system;
													- You don't need permission to scan the target;
- Active Information Gathering   - in this process, you gather as much information as possible by actively engaging with the system;
													- You **NEED PERMISSION** to scan the target;

---
##### What information can we gather?

In a passive scan:
- IP addresses, DNS information;
- hidden files;
- names, emails, phone numbers, physical addresses, social media profiles;
- domains, subdomains, domains ownerships;
- web technologies that are being used;

In an active scan:
- open ports;
- learn about the network and the organization infrastructure;
- enumerate information;

---
##### What processes can we use?

- Website Reconnaissance
- Footprinting - is similar to Web. Recon., but you gather more info;

---
##### Tools and Commands

- Terminal
``` Powershell

whatis host # similar to -help in cmd

host domain # performs a DNS lookup; it translates the domain into the related IPv4, IPv6


```

- On the actual Website
	- we can check for any information displayed, like authors, emails, social media links, etc. 

- On the URL
	- domain/robots.txt - is a file from a Search Engine index that tells what files the Search Engine to index;
