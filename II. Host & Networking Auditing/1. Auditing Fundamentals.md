- this moves along with the business, but it ramains this triangle;

1. Confidentiality - information shared with whom you decide
2. Integrity - authorized changes only; what you change or do should match it without alteration
3. Availability - offer service when people need it
4. Balance - balance between all CIA Triad

##### Compliance

Do we have to?
- A lot comes down to risk management. And sometimes a company might accept the risk.

Regulations?
> Sometimes certains Countries or Governments, or Companies have regulations. Things that **must** to be respected because otherwise you can be fined and loose the oportunity to expand further.

- PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
- CPPA - California Consumer Privacy Act
- SOX - Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

##### Frameworks and Maturity
How do we implement business needs? All comes down to business needs.
- Frameworks - things that are required or things that we can start with. The following are free:
	- ISO/IEC 27000 - International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission
		- ISO/IEC 27001 - Information Technology - Security Techniques - Information Security Management Systems - Requiremenets;
		- is the base, the guideline
		- ISO/IEC 27002 - Code of practice for Information Security Controls
		- how to implement it
	- COBIT - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies
		- is business focused and defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT
	- NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology
		- NIST Special Publication 800-53B provides a set of baseline security controls and privacy controls for information systems and organizations
	- CIS - Center for Internet Security
		- set of 18 prioritized safeguards to mitigate the most prevalent cyber-attacks
	- CMMC - Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
		- a training, certification, and 3rd party assessment program of cybersecurity in the US government of Defense Industrial Base
	- ASD - Australian Cyber Security Center - Essential Eight Maturity Model

Tier your recommendation:

1. Definitely do that - it's very severe and will most probably lead to a breach 
2. Probably implement that
3. Could implement that
4. I also recommend that
