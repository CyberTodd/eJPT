##### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is an NTFS (New Technology File System) file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS (Hierarchical File System).

Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files in order to evade detection.
