A Brief History

- as of 2021 - is the prelevant OS on the market (>= 70%)
- makes it the prime target for attackers
- given the popularity of Windows, most of these vulnerabilities have publicly accessible exploit code making them relatively straightforward to exploit

Types of Windows Vulnerabilities:

- Information Disclosure - an attacker has access to confidential data
- Buffer Overflows - caused by programming error, allows attackers to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to allocated memory addresses
- Remote Code Execution - allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the target system
- Privilege Escalation - allows an attacker to elevate their privileges after initial compromise
- Denial of Service - allows an attacker to consume a system/ host resources consequently preventing the system from functioning normally
