> Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system.

> A kernel is a computer program that is the core of an OS and has complete control over the resource and hardware on a system. Windows NT is the Windows kernet.


##### Windows Kernel Exploits

- Privilege escalation on Windows systems will typically follow the following methodology:
	- Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
	- Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system

Tools:
- Windows-Exploit-Suggester - is a tool that compares a target patch lvl agains the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins.
